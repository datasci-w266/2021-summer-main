For example, if you're fine-tuning a large pretrained transformer model using TensorFlow then you might benefit from a TPU if you can access one. (They aren't always available.)  If you are training a large neural net (without TensorFlow) then you will almost certainly train much faster using a GPU rather than just the CPU.\n",
